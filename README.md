# GrabClass for FSU
Never miss out on a class you need again!

This is small JVM application which monitors the FSU class enrollment
portal and notifies your mobile phone when new seats become available.

You'll need a GroupMe developer account as that is the mechanism
by which notifications are delivered. Also, you'll obviously
need a myFSU account.

Directions for using GrabClass can be found in `main.kt`.
